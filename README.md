### Nice to meet you, I'm Jake 🎶

Software engineer with a proven ability to be an effective communicator as a member of a team or as a team leader. While directing a team of 4 developers, I outlined daily objectives and tasks suited to each members’ strengths to ensure their growth and success. I worked closely with clients to understand their needs in order to deliver a quality product that satisfied all desired criteria. My passion for coding also drove me to complete a 1,000+ hour coding bootcamp focused on HTML, CSS, SASS, Javascript and React to strengthen my overall coding acumen. I am motivated to grow and nurture these passions while working within a collaborative, talented development team focused on developing high-quality solutions to meaningful problems.
